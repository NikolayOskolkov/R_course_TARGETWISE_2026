## Outline - R basics

- Concepts
- Motivation
- RStudio
- Graphics
- Third-party Libraries

# Concepts

## Computer Programming

Computer programming is the process of performing particular computations, usually by designing and building executable computer programs.

## Programming language

A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.

Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical.

## R

- Programming language
- For Statistics, Data Analysis & Graphics
- Free & Open-source
- Refers to both: the language & the interpreter

## RStudio

- User interface for working with R
- Wrapper around the R language
- Extends what R can do & facilitates writing R code
- Free & Open-source

# Motivation

## Why R?

- Rely on written commands instead of point & click
- Great for reproducibility
- Interdisciplinary & extensible
- Works for data of all shapes & sizes
- Amazing graphics!
- Large & welcoming community
- Lots of packages
- Open-source & cross-platform

## Alternatives to R

- __Stata__ (proprietary)
  - Most popular statistical software in economics
  - Easy to use for standard methods
  - Not a good programming language

- __Matlab__ (proprietary)
  - Numerical programming environment
  - Matrix based

## Alternatives to R

- __Python__ (open-source)
  - General purpose programming language
  - Standard in industry
  - Not targeted toward data analysis and statistics

- __Julia__ (open-source)
  - New language for numerical programming
  - Fast
  - Increasingly popular in macro / for solving complicated structural models

# RStudio

---

```{r fig01/slide1, echo = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'RStudio', out.width = '100%', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/nikolay-oskolkov/TARGETWISE/Teaching/R_course_2026/RcourseUNAM/slides/figs/fig01/Slide1.jpeg")
```

---

```{r fig01/slide2, echo = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'RStudio', out.width = '100%', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/nikolay-oskolkov/TARGETWISE/Teaching/R_course_2026/RcourseUNAM/slides/figs/fig01/Slide2.jpeg")
```

---

```{r fig01/slide3, echo = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'RStudio', out.width = '100%', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/nikolay-oskolkov/TARGETWISE/Teaching/R_course_2026/RcourseUNAM/slides/figs/fig01/Slide3.jpeg")
```

---

```{r fig01/slide4, echo = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'RStudio', out.width = '100%', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/nikolay-oskolkov/TARGETWISE/Teaching/R_course_2026/RcourseUNAM/slides/figs/fig01/Slide4.jpeg")
```

---

```{r fig01/slide5, echo = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'RStudio', out.width = '100%', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/nikolay-oskolkov/TARGETWISE/Teaching/R_course_2026/RcourseUNAM/slides/figs/fig01/Slide5.jpeg")
```

---

```{r fig01/slide6, echo = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'RStudio', out.width = '100%', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/nikolay-oskolkov/TARGETWISE/Teaching/R_course_2026/RcourseUNAM/slides/figs/fig01/Slide6.jpeg")
```

---

```{r fig01/slide7, echo = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'RStudio', out.width = '100%', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/nikolay-oskolkov/TARGETWISE/Teaching/R_course_2026/RcourseUNAM/slides/figs/fig01/Slide7.jpeg")
```

## The working directory

- Where R will look for & save files
- Scripts should refer to files in relation to root of working directory
- Only refer to files within this structure
- Check working directory with the `getwd()` function

## Suggested subdirectories

- `data/` => for raw data and intermediate datasets
- `data_output/` => modified versions of raw data
- `documents/` => outlines, drafts, other text
- `fig_output/` => graphics generated by scripts
- `scripts/` => R scripts for different analyses or plotting

## Working in the console or the script?

- Can type commands directly in console
- All console commands are *forgotten* after each session
- Script is key for reproducibility
- Send commands to R console from script using `Ctrl` + `Enter`

## Accepting commands

- When ready:	`>`
- If waiting: `+`
- Cancel commands by pressing `Esc`
- Stop sign when working
- Anything after `#` will not be read

# Workshop I

# Graphics

## Visualization

- R has one of the best graphics integrated
- Highly customizable
- Visualize plots on the spot or save to disk
- Third-party libraries also available

# Third-party Libraries

## Packages

- Created by other users
- Libraries of functions or data
- Provided to community at no charge
- Extends the capacity of R
- Often improve on Base R functions
- __CRAN__ is the main repository for packages
