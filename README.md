# R Programming for Statistics and Machine Learning

## Instructors

- Dr. Nikolay Oskolkov, Metabolic Research Group Leader, LIOS, Riga, Latvia
- Dr. Daniel Rivas, postdoctoral fellow in Metabolic Research Group, LIOS, Riga, Latvia

## Course overview
This course is designed for participants who are at beginner-level or have basic familiarity with R and are ready to advance their programming and computational data-analysis skills. Building on foundational R concepts, the course emphasizes implementing core statistical and machine-learning algorithms from scratch. Alongside deeper coverage of data structures, programming paradigms and functional programming, participants will explore practical applications in bioinformatics. Students will progress from fundamental programming concepts to implementing key analytical tools, including non-parametric and permutation-based statistical tests, linear mixed models (LMMs), dimensionality reduction (PCA, tSNE, UMAP) and clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means), random forests, and simple neural networks directly in base R. 

## Target audience and assumed background
We assume some basic awareness of UNIX environment, as well as at least beginner level of R and / or Python programming.

## Learning outcomes
By completing this course, you will:

- Understand the basics of statistical and machine learning approaches to biological data analysis
- Gain an overview of basic machine learning algorithms and their applications
- Be able to choose the right algorithms and approaches to answer your specific research question
- Gain confidence in learning new methods needed to answer your research question
